I am a third-year PhD student in strategic management at [<font color="#1e90ff">Jones Graduate School of Business</font>](https://business.rice.edu/), [<font color="#1e90ff">Rice University</font>](https://www.rice.edu/), advised by [<font color="#1e90ff">Prof. Anastasiya Zavyalova</font>](https://business.rice.edu/person/anastasiya-zavyalova) and [<font color="#1e90ff">Prof. Alessandro Piazza</font>](https://business.rice.edu/person/alessandro-piazza). I am currently interested in social evaluations (i.e., status, reputation, celebrity, trust, legitimacy, stigma) and digital platforms.<br>
