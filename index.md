## About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD student in strategic management at the [Jones Graduate School of Business](https://business.rice.edu/), [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), advised by [Prof. Anastasiya Zavyalova](https://business.rice.edu/person/anastasiya-zavyalova) and [Prof. Alessandro Piazza](https://business.rice.edu/person/alessandro-piazza).

I am currently interested in **social evaluations** (i.e., status, reputation, celebrity, trust, legitimacy, stigma) and digital platforms.
