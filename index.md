I am a third-year PhD student in strategic management at 
<a href="https://business.rice.edu/" style="color:blue">Jones Graduate School of Business</a>, 
<a href="https://www.rice.edu/" style="color:blue">Rice University</a>, 
advised by 
<a href="https://business.rice.edu/person/anastasiya-zavyalova" style="color:blue">Prof. Anastasiya Zavyalova</a> and 
<a href="https://business.rice.edu/person/alessandro-piazza" style="color:blue">Prof. Alessandro Piazza</a>. 
I am currently interested in social evaluations (i.e., status, reputation, celebrity, trust, legitimacy, stigma) and digital platforms.<br>
