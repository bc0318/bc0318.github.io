## About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD student in strategic management at the <span style="color:#1e90ff">Jones Graduate School of Business</span>, <span style="color:#1e90ff">Rice University</span>, advised by <span style="color:#1e90ff">Prof. Anastasiya Zavyalova</span> and <span style="color:#1e90ff">Prof. Alessandro Piazza</span>. I am currently interested in social evaluations (i.e., status, reputation, celebrity, trust, legitimacy, stigma) and digital platforms.
