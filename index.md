## About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD student in strategic management at the [<span style="color:#1e90ff">Jones Graduate School of Business</span>](https://business.rice.edu/), [<span style="color:#1e90ff">Rice University</span>](https://www.rice.edu/), advised by [<span style="color:#1e90ff">Prof. Anastasiya Zavyalova</span>](https://business.rice.edu/person/anastasiya-zavyalova) and [<span style="color:#1e90ff">Prof. Alessandro Piazza</span>](https://business.rice.edu/person/alessandro-piazza). I am currently interested in social evaluations (i.e., status, reputation, celebrity, trust, legitimacy, stigma) and digital platforms.
